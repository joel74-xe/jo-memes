🤖 JoMeme Bot



This is a discord bot which sends random memes from reddit. As of now I have only added certain commands but I will be adding more soon.

Currently, it supports the following commands:



📌 Available Commands:


✅ $hello – The bot greets you with a friendly message.

✅ $link – Provides a link to the bot.

✅ $meme – Fetches and sends a random meme from Reddit.

✅ $insta_dev – Shares Instagram account link of the developer (or your profile, if

applicable).



🚀 More features coming soon! I will be adding additional commands and functionality to make the bot even better. Stay tuned!

Building this bot has been a great learning experience! I gained hands-on knowledge in:

Working with Discord.py to create bots.
Fetching data from Reddit APIs to retrieve memes.
Handling bot commands and user interactions effectively.
Understanding how bots work in Discord servers and how to deploy them.




⚠️ Challenges Faced

Honestly I didn't really face any challenges since Codedex had already provided a tutorial on how to create a discord bot. They also provided with a reddit meme source.
